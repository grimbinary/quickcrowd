# quickcrowd

I created this script to quickly setup Docker and CrowdSec together so that it makes it easier to run the 'cscli dashboard setup' command. It determines the user's OS (currently only Mac and Linux) and downloads the appropriate installers.

The intended use case behind this is to be able to enroll an endpoint as a security engine to gain better visibility.
